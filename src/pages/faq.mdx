## What is the methodology of this Alignment Assembly?
We are using the process of an alignment assembly, an experiment in collective deliberation and decision-making. [Alignment Assemblies](https://cip.org/blog/alignment), are participant-guided discussions aimed at bringing technology into alignment with collective values. This model was pioneered by the Collective Intelligence Project (CIP), led by Divya Siddarth and Saffron Huang, and this model has been used by the government of Taiwan, OpenAI, and Anthropic.

**The alignment assembly model is a Collective Response Process in which participants both generate proposals and vote on them.**

## How does it work in practice?
We are using Pol.is, an open-source, real-time survey platform, for input and voting. In Pol.is, participants can submit and vote on short text statements; vote options are “Agree,” “Disagree,” and “Unsure.” Pol.is automatically creates, in real-time, an analysis of the results - please look at it as you answer the questions to better understand what additional questions you would like to ask to the other participants.

## What does the process look like?
We have seeded the survey with an initial set of statements to set the tone and scope of the conversation. When you join the survey, you will first answer the seed statements. Afterward, all participants are encouraged to add their own statements and to vote on their peers’ statements. Over time, the pool of statements grows, and new participants answer the collaboratively created set of questions.

## How do I vote?
Vote by pressing Agree, Disagree, or Pass/Unsure.

**Agree** indicates that you agree with the statement.

**Disagree** indicates that you disagree with the statement.

At it's simplest, **Pass/Unsure** indicates that you are feeling uncertain. But more specifically, it's encouraged to be used for any number of reasons, not limited to the following:
- I don't know.
- I don't have an opinion.
- I need more information.
- I don't want to answer.
- This comment is making me think too hard and I want to move on.
- I abstain.
- I have secret thoughts.
- It is simply the case that agree and disagree do not fit my intentions for this comment.
- I both agree and disagree.
- This comment contains multiple ideas.
- I don't feel strongly.
- This isn't that important to me.
- I reject a premise or assumption underlying the statement.

## How do I add statements?
Below the voting section, there is a written text box. Write your statement below. You should not reply directly to other statements you see, as other participants won’t see statements in the same order. Having said that, if your reaction to another statement inspires an alternative or improved statement, we encourage you to submit it.

You can write as many statements as you like, but please focus on raising new ideas, perspectives, experiences, or issues. The best time to submit new statements is after you’ve responded to all or most of the existing ones.

### What makes a good statement?
All statements are welcome that help participants (including you) feel heard.

Having said that, there is an art to writing powerful and important statements. Such statements tend to either “teach” or “surprise” other participants. There are two general types of statements you might submit:

**Contrasting statements.** These statements differentiate us and our groups. If these become surfaced in the Polis visualization, they show up when a specific group is clicked.

Contrasting statements are particularly helpful early in a Polis conversation, as they help a diversity of groups present themselves for investigation by other participants. Being a bit divisive early is actually helpful here, because the divisions are what most people are drawn into, and it’s the surface over which exploration happens. These statements help us understand how we differ from one another. Sometimes, the thing that captures that difference is “tone”: one group might express something differently than how another group would, even if they mostly agree. You can submit statements that reflect unique things about your group or the way they think and speak, that you think other groups might disagree with.

If you’re trying to write statements of this type, you might imagine it like sharing “this is who we are” or “this is how I believe we’re unique”.

**Consensus statements.** These statements tend to bridge some or all groups.  If these become surfaced in the Polis visualization, they show up under “Majority Opinion” statements.

The best consensus statements are not just true, but often _surprising_. For example, the statement “I am a human” would likely show up as a Majority Opinion statement in the tool, but it is incredibly uninteresting and unsurprising. The reward of submitting consensus statements is in finding the tricky or unintuitive statements that might exist below the surface of the obvious disagreements. You can use the Polis visualization to build up a better understanding of the other groups, and try to think of a new statement that would win over members of other groups.

If you’re trying to write statements of this type, you might imagine it like asking the crowd “is this something we have in common?” though you should of course frame it as a statement and not an open question.


## Is the survey only in English?
The official language of the process is English and we do offer an option to participate in Spanish. In addition to that, Pol.is offers an automated translation option for the statements. This means that statements can be written in different languages and understood by the global audience.

## What is the timeframe for this process?
The process will start in mid-February and end in mid-March.

## What is the pre-survey for?
We have designed a pre-survey to collect some basic information and to better understand users' backgrounds, experience with openness and AI, and the region of the world that they come from. This data will be combined with results from the pol.is survey to further refine our understanding of AI and the commons.

## What is going to happen with my contact data?
We will only use your email to contact you about this process and delete it once it is over.

## What is the platform we’re using to vote?

We’re using [Pol.is](https://pol.is/home), an open-source, real-time survey platform for input and voting. It has been used for the past ten years in deliberative settings, from peacebuilding to citizens assemblies and tech governance.

## Is there Translation?

We will use Pol.is’s automatic translation features to reach more audiences.

Pol.is uses your browser language to translate with Google Translate. You can change your browser language in your browser’s settings. It will translate responses to whatever language you choose.

Similarly, your responses will be translated automatically when others view it.

Here’s how to set the browser language settings on [chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/173424?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) and [firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-another-language).

Additionally, for all content on our website, Karisma Foundation in Colombia has provided translations.

## What is the end result you are aiming for?
At the end of the process, we will produce a report with the outcomes of the assembly and a proposal for a refined set of [these principles](https://creativecommons.org/2023/10/07/making-ai-work-for-creators-and-the-commons/). As the policy debate about the commons and AI develops, we hope the assembly will provide insights into better regulation of generative AI.
