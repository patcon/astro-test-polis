## What is the methodology of this Alignment Assembly?

We will use the process of an alignment assembly, an experiment in collective deliberation and decision-making. [Alignment Assemblies](https://cip.org/blog/alignment), are participant-guided discussions aimed at bringing technology into alignment with collective values. This model was pioneered by the Collective Intelligence Project (CIP), led by Divya Siddarth and Saffron Huang, and this model has been used by the government of Taiwan, OpenAI, and Anthropic.

**The alignment assembly model is a Collective Response Process in which participants both generate proposals and vote on them.**

We will use Pol.is, an open-source, real-time survey platform, for input and voting. In Pol.is, participants can submit and vote on short text statements; vote options are “Agree,” “Disagree,” and “Unsure.” Pol.is automatically creates, in real-time, an analysis of the results - please look at it as you answer the questions to better understand what additional questions you would like to ask to the other participants.

We have seeded the survey with an initial set of statements to set the tone and scope of the conversation. When you join the survey, you will first answer the seed statements. Afterward, all participants are encouraged to add their own statements and to vote on their peers’ statements. Over time, the pool of statements grows, and new participants answer the collaboratively created set of questions.

Pol.is offers an automated translation option for the statements. This means that statements can be written in different languages and understood by the global audience.

We have designed a pre-survey to collect some basic information and to better understand users' backgrounds, experience with openness and AI, and the region of the world that they come from. This data will be combined with results from the pol.is survey to further refine our understanding of AI and the commons.

## What is the platform we’re using to vote?

We’re using [Pol.is](https://pol.is/home), an open-source, real-time survey platform for input and voting. It has been used for the past ten years in deliberative settings, from peacebuilding to citizens assemblies and tech governance.

## Is there Translation?

We will use Pol.is’s automatic translation features to reach more audiences.

Pol.is uses your browser language to translate with Google Translate. You can change your browser language in your browser’s settings. It will translate responses to whatever language you choose.

Similarly, your responses will be translated automatically when others view it.

Here’s how to set the browser language settings on [chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/173424?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) and [firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-another-language).

Additionally, for all content on our website, Karisma Foundation in Colombia has provided translations.
