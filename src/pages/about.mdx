## About The Assembly

The purpose of this online Alignment Assembly with the **open movement activists, creators, and organizations building and stewarding the digital commons** is to explore principles and considerations for regulating generative AI. We want to bring to the conversation the perspectives of:

- Activists and experts, including digital rights advocates, legal experts
- Stewards: people from organizations that steward collections that are part of the Digital Commons such as Wikimedia, Open Access repositories, and heritage collections
- Creators: people who create works that form part of  the Digital Commons, broadly: not only visual artists and musicians but also researchers who do open science or open source AI programmers

The assembly is being hosted by [Open Future](), [Fundacion Karisma](), and [Creative Commons]().

## Background

One of the most pressing questions facing open movement activists, creators, and organizations is how artificial intelligence (AI) will shape and affect the Digital Commons. So much of generative AI is built on the digital infrastructure of the commons and uses the vast quantity of images, text, video, and rich data resources of the internet. Organizations train their models with trillions of tokens from publicly available datasets like CommonCrawl, GitHub open source projects, Wikipedia, and ArXiV.

Access to the Commons has enabled incredible innovations while creating the conditions for the concentration of power in entities that are able to amass the immense energy and data needed to train a generative AI. Community consultations at conferences like Mozfest, RightsCon, Creative Commons Summit, and Wikimania have also revealed concerns about transparency, bias, fairness, and attribution in AI.

## Outcomes

The Alignment Assembly on AI and the Commons builds on work from Creative Commonsâ€™s summit AI and the Commons in October, where Open Future and Creative Commons hosted a workshop on generative AI and its impact on the commons. The group agreed and released seven principles for regulating generative AI, and those principles can be found here.

We treat the principles as a starting point. We are using the assembly methodology and the pol.is a tool to understand where there is consensus and which principles generate controversy. In particular, how much alignment there is between the perspectives of activists, creators, and stewards of the commons.

At the end of the process, we will produce a report with the outcomes of the assembly and a proposal for a refined set of principles. As the policy debate about the commons and AI develops, we hope the assembly will provide insights into better regulation of generative AI.

**More information about the methodology can be found in the FAQ**
